# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to my Github profile!
Here you can find some more information about my work experience and learning hard skills.


## I extremely like to share experience 
   and that's why I also work as a programmer teacher. I think, the better way to get to know something is to explain it to another person, and even if it's a child it's way better to express the same to coleague :)

I teach children about such technologies as HTML and CSS, JS, Python, Figma, PhotoShop.



Currently I'm studing: 
- Next.js
- React Native 
- GraphQL
- Node.js
- MongoDB
