            I'm highly motivated specialist, who always tries to find a better
            solutions to design an Apps. I extreme programming lover, that means
            I have strong desire to learn and exchange my experiece. Currently,
            I'm developing my hard and soft skills, especially storytelling, and I
            practice it with children. I deeply believe, if I can describe
            complex concepts to children, I can tell it even to somebody with
            experiece.
